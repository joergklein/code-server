# Wiki for Visual Studio Code on a (virtual) server

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).

Run [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) on any machine anywhere and access it in the browser.
